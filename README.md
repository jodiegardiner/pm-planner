## Issues

Having your significant other as your client can mean shifting requirements! 
Users are so used to the invisible nature of development now that what they perceive as a trivial feature can mean many lines of code to write and a cascade of issues to tackle.

## Code for the future

There is a "Pregnancy Events" model which is in preparation for a built-in calendar for the app.  A user will be able to request calendar events which will be calculated off the due date in a similar way to the Google Calendar events system, as well as being able to add individual events as required.  These events will be store in as Pregnancy Events and will provide a record of appointments made/kept, a crucial part of this CRM's functionality.
